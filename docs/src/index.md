# 1 - LocalCongruence.jl

`LocalCongruence.jl` is a [Julia](http://julialang.org) library that provides
tools for managing local congruences of Chain Complexes.

The algorithms here presented are all official variation of those we proposed
in [Local congruence of chain complexes](https://arxiv.org/).

In particular, given a set of local chain complexes in
LinearAlgebraicRepresentation standars, this Julia Module compute a the single
corresponding global complex using ``\epsilon``-congruence of cells,
solving topologically the numerical inaccuracies of floating-point arithmetics.

The code is currently working as part of the `Lar.Arrangment` workflow.
